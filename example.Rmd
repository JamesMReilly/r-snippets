## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Markdown features

Markdown is a "Markup" language that lets us write out our formatted documents in plaintext. We can use **bold** and _italics_

We can make headers to format our work

___

#Main header

##Sub Header

###Smaller header

___

Add a break in the page to separate content

create formatted code blocks in a variety of languages

###R
```r
df <- read.csv(file = "myFile.csv");
summary(df)
```

###Java
```java
public int addTheseInts(int a, int b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

###JavaScript
```javascript
const addThese = (a, b) => a + b
```


## Including Plots

We can write code that evaluates, here we can embed a plot for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

Here is the sampel line without the echo=FALSE as an example

```{r sample with echo}
plot(pressure)
```

## Importing libraries

We can import the libraries that we have been using frequently in our assignments just as well (I add message=FALSE so that all the output on the library import is suppressed)

```{r import the libraries, message=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
```

```{r using the libraries}
data(diamonds)
summary(diamonds)
df <- diamonds %>% select("price", "clarity", "cut")

df.cutPrice <- ggplot(data = df, aes(x = cut, y = price)) + geom_boxplot()
df.clarityPlot <- ggplot(data = df, aes(x = clarity, y = price)) + geom_boxplot()
df.cutPrice
df.clarityPlot
```
