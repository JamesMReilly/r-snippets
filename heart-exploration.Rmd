## Summary



## Data and Structure 

```{r load the heart data}
heart <- read.csv(file = 'data/heart.csv', header = TRUE)
dim <- dim(heart)
head(heart)

```

The dataset contains `r dim[0]` records with `r dim[1]` variables for each patient
## Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
