Before we Markdown, we Markup!
========================================================

"A markup language is a computer text system for annotating a document in a ways that is _syntactically distinguishable_ from the text"

- TeX (created 1978)
- HTML (created 1993)
- XML (created 2008)

So why Markdown?
========================================================

Markdown is a _lightweight markup language_ designed to be **unintrusive** and **easy to interpret**
