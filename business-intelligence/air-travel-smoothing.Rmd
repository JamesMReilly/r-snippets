## Loading the dataset

The datset includes time series information of total travel miles by month for three modes of travel. We will focus specifically on Air travel.

```{r}
df <- read.csv(file = "./data/Sept11Travel.csv")
head(df)
```



## Setting up data partition before September 2001

The first 141 rows of data are pre-September-11, and are the focus of this analysis. I will separate the dataset into two segments at this index.

```{r}
trainingRows <- 141
validationRows <- nrow(df) - trainingRows

df.air.train <- ts(df$AirRPM, start = c(1990,1), end = c(2001,08), frequency = 12)
df.air.actual <- ts(df$AirRPM, start = c(1990,1), end = c(2004,04), frequency = 12)
```


## Plotting Air Travel Time Series pre-Event

a. Create a time plot for the pre-even AIR time series, What time series components appear from the plot?

```{r}
plot(df.air.train, xlim=c(1991,2001.5), ylab="Revenue Passenger Miles", main="Air Travel Miles over Time")
axis(1, at = seq(1990,2000.66), labels=format(seq(1990, 2000, 1)))
```


The plot for air travel over time shows both a positive linear trend in growth of total travel and annual seasonality. The presence of these two time series components eliminates most smoothing methods from consideration, leaving Holt-Winters exponential smoothing as the best choice.


## Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing

Below is a demonstration of building a time series forecast for the months following September 11 based on an exponential time series (Holt-Winter's)

```{r}
hw.air <- ets(df.air.train, model="MAA") #MAA = Multiplicative error, additive trend, additive seasonality, Holt-Winters Exponential

hw.air.pred <- forecast(hw.air, h = validationRows, level = 0)
plot(hw.air.pred, xlim = c(1991,2005))
```


## Seasonally adjusted smoothing

Figure 18.6 shows a time plot of the seaosnally adjusted pre-September-11 AIR series. Which of the following smoothing methods would be adequate for forecasting this series?

* Moving Average
* Simple exponential
* Holt exponential
* Holt-Winter's exponential

We can remove Moving Average and Simple Exponential smoothing from consideration because the seasonally-adjusted data still has a growth trend. These methods are for sets with no trend or seasonality.

Because the data is seasonally adjusted, we can treat it as if seasonality is removed. This leaves us with **Holt exponential** as the best method because we do not need to model the seasonality as provided by Holt-winter's exponential.
