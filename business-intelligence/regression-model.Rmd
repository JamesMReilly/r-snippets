```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


```{r load all required libraries, message=FALSE, include=FALSE}
library(forecast)
```

## Loading Data
```{r}
df.not.seasonal <- read.csv(file = './data/TOTALNSA.csv')
df.seasonal <- read.csv(file = './data/TOTALSA.CSV')

head(df.not.seasonal)
head(df.seasonal)
```

## Time Series Regression


```{r}
seasonal.ts <- ts(df.seasonal$TOTALSA, start = c(1976, 1), end=c(2020,3), freq = 12)

seasonal.arima <- Arima(seasonal.ts, order = c(1,0,0))
seasonal.arima
```

```{r}
not.seasonal.ts <- ts(df.not.seasonal$TOTALNSA, start = c(1976, 1), end=c(2020,3), freq = 12)

not.seasonal.arima <- Arima(not.seasonal.ts, order = c(1,0,0))
not.seasonal.arima
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
