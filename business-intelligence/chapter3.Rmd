## 3.1: Shipments of Household Appliances

```{r, message=FALSE, include=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
```

Prior to making visualizations with the data, I redefine the levels (or order) of the Quarter factor by hand so that all graphs will follow a Q1->Q2->Q3->Q4 order by year. I also added a column for the Quarter and Year separated by hand, so that I can eventually aggregate by these variables for further summary.

```{r}
df <- read.csv(file = "./data/ApplianceSHipments.csv")

df$Quarter <- factor(df$Quarter, levels = c(
"Q1-1985",
"Q2-1985",
"Q3-1985",
"Q4-1985",
"Q1-1986",
"Q2-1986",
"Q3-1986",
"Q4-1986",
"Q1-1987",
"Q2-1987",
"Q3-1987",
"Q4-1987",
"Q1-1988",
"Q2-1988",
"Q3-1988",
"Q4-1988",
"Q1-1989",
"Q2-1989",
"Q3-1989",
"Q4-1989"))

df$Q <- c("Q1","Q2","Q3","Q4","Q1","Q2","Q3","Q4","Q1","Q2","Q3","Q4","Q1","Q2","Q3","Q4","Q1","Q2","Q3","Q4")

df$Year <- c("1985","1985","1985","1985","1986","1986","1986","1986","1987","1987","1987","1987","1988","1988","1988","1988","1989","1989","1989","1989")

df$Q <- factor(df$Q, levels=c("Q1","Q2","Q3","Q4"))
df$Year <- factor(df$Year)
```


**a.** Create a well-formatted time plot of the data using R.

```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(x=Quarter, y=Shipments, group=1)) + 
  geom_line() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))
```

**b.** Does there appear to be a quarterly pattern? zoom in to the range of 3500-5000 on the _y_-axis
```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(x=Quarter, y=Shipments, group=1)) + 
  geom_line() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(3500, 5000))
```

There seems to be an annual cycle with the highest shipments appearing in Q2 every year, and the least in Q4 most years. This can be seen by plotting the performance of each quarter against each other.


**c.** Create a chart with four separate lines, one for each Quarter, is there a difference between the quarters?

```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(x=Year, y=Shipments, colour=Q, group=Q)) + 
  geom_line() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(3500, 5000))
```

In all but one year, the most shipments was in Q2 and the least in Q4. The patterns seen in the previous visualization were confirmed objectively.

**d.** Create a line graph of the series at a yearly aggregated level

```{r}
df <- df %>%
  select(Shipments) %>%
  aggregate(by=list(Year=df$Year), FUN=sum)

ggplot(df, aes(x=Year, y=Shipments, group=1)) + 
  geom_line() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(15000, 20000))
```

The years were aggregated in using `dplyr` to group all 4 quarters with the `sum` function

## 3.2: Sales of Riding Mowers

```{r}
df <- read.csv(file = "./data/RidingMowers.csv")

head(df)

ggplot(df, aes(x=Income, y=Lot_Size, colour=Ownership)) + 
  geom_point(size = 4, aes(colour= Ownership)) +
  scale_colour_viridis_d()

```

A scatter plot differentiated by owner category shows a clear differentiation between Nonowners and Owners in the dataset across both variables

## 3.3: Laptop Sales at a London Computer Chain

**a.** At what price are the laptops actually selling

```{r}
df <- read.csv(file = "./data/LaptopSales.csv")

df <- df %>%
  filter(!is.na(Retail.Price))

df$store <- factor(df$store.X) 

set.seed(15) # so sample() is reproducible
newnames <- paste0("Store ", LETTERS[1:nlevels(df$store)], 1:nlevels(df$store))
df$anon <- as.character(factor(df$store, labels=sample(newnames)))


df.average <- df %>%
  select(Retail.Price) %>%
  aggregate(by=list(Store=df$anon), FUN=mean)

ggplot(df.average, aes(x = Store, y = Retail.Price)) +
  geom_col() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) +
  ylim(0,550)
```

The margins are very close, but it looks like Store J10 has the highest average sale price and Store F6 has the lowest, a box plot will introduce better comparisons

**b.** box plot comparisons

```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(x=anon, y=Retail.Price)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))
```

Store J10 has the higest average. Several stores sell laptops in what appears to be the same price range such as C3, F6, G7, H8, and K11.

## 3.4: Laptop Sales at a London Computer Chain: Interactive Visualization

**a.** Prices Questions

*At what price are laptops actually selling?*

*Does price change with time?*

Laptops are selling between $450 and $550, with peak prices mid-year, leading just infront of the highest period of sales

![Monthly Sales](./pictures/Monthly Sales.png)


*Are prices consistent across retail outlets?*

There is no significant difference in price by location, the lowest average price is 466, with the highest being 522. Using circle size to represent the average retail price of a specific store there is no visible outliers.

![Average Prices By Location](./pictures/PriceByLocation.png)

*How does price change with configuration?*

Price changes widely by configuration, here are a selected range of configurations pricing over 700 or under 350 on average, showing several selections at different price points by configuration.

**b.** Location Questions

*Where are the stores and customers located?*

A majority of customers are in the center cluster where there are also the most stores. This is likely the central downtown area.

![Customer Location](./pictures/Customer Location.png)


*Which stores are selling the most?*

The central location stores by the most customers have the most sales

[Location Sales](./pictures/Total Sales.png)


*How far would customers travel to buy a laptop?*

The average customer traveled further for a sale in the exterior perimeter stores, while average distance in the central customer stores was the lowest. Suggesting that a majority of the customers leave near the central customer and tend to shop at their closest location.

**d.** Configuration Questions

*Do all stores sell all configurations?*

Most stores sell nearly 100% of the configurations, colored by number of distinct configurations sold at the store using step sizes, all stores are the max color.
