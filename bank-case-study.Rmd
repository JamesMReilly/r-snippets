```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
rm(list=ls())
```


```{r load libraries, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
library(Boruta)

```


```{r load the data}
bankruptcy <- read.csv("data/Bankruptcy.csv")
set.seed(4567)


bankruptcy.boruta <- Boruta(D ~ ., data = bankruptcy, doTrace = 1) 
print(bankruptcy.boruta)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
